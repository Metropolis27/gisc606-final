## i. What was your favorite part of the class?

My favorite part of this class was the step-by-step guides that Professor Alex provided for the use of GitHub and Codespaces. Before this course and the course that Alex taught last semester, I had only used GitHub one other time for an undergraduate course at San Diego State University. To be honest, the GitHub portion of the course at SDSU was somewhat overwhelming at the time, and I did not feel like I got as much out of that experience as I could have.

Conversely, Alex' calm and friendly approach, as well as the step-by-step guides provided on YouTube helped me to learn a lot more about these tools at my own pace, and I am finishing this course feeling much more confident at utilizing them in the future.

## ii. What was your least favorite part about the class?

My least favorite part about this class was the lack of breaks provided during active class time. This class goes on for several consecutive hours during each session, and I think that having a few 10 minute breaks each class would help me stay more focused and engaged in the lesson at hand.

## iii. Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?

I recommend that two 10 minute breaks are provided for each class session to improve the class experience for future students.
