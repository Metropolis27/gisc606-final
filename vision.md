## i. What is your dream GIS/tech job?

My dream GIS job would be to work as a GIS analyst for the National Parks Service, ideally within a national park itself.

I love being in nature and visiting national parks, so having the opportunity to do so every day over the course of my career would be a dream come true.

Furthermore, I think that performing duties in this role that contribute to preserving the park's natural resources and beauty would be very fulfilling to me.

## ii. What GIS applications or technologies excite you the most?

Coding and working with scripts, especially with Python excite me the most.

I have worked in the field of GIS as a technician since about a year before entering the MS GIS program at CSULB. Before starting this program, I did not utilize coding at work but I envisioned the value of doing so to streamline and automate daily tasks to make my job easier and make myself more valuable to my organization. Therefore, my desire to utilize programming in my day job was a major reason why I decided to enroll in the MS GIS program at CSULB. 

I am happy to say that I have begun to do this in my job since the start of 2024 and it has helped me to become more valuable to my employer. Therefore, I want to continue my coding journey after I finish this program because I know that doing so will help me advance further in my career.

Also, from my experiences at my job and the coursework in the MS GIS program, I can see the value in increasing my proficiency at database management. Likewise, I think that continuing to hone this skill will help me to advance further in my career as a GIS professional.

## iii. What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?

After this semester ends I would like to continue to develop my Python coding skills. I will be utilizing Esri academy and other web courses to gain further experience at developing this skill and finding new ideas for how to utilize it in my current job. I will also be attending the Esri User Conference in July and I plan to attend at least a few Python workshops during the event.

Regarding non-GIS hobbies, I would like to do more hiking and camping with my wife. We live in a rural, mountainous area that has many trails and other recreational opportunities right outside our front door, so we want to take advantage of our beautiful surroundings as the weather gets warmer in the coming months.
